TinyAKE: A More Practicable and Trustable Scheme for Authenticated Key Establishment in WSNs. 

The characteristics of high loss rate, resource constraint, being eager for good security havenâ€™t been fully considered in the existing key establishment protocols of wireless sensor networks. Analyzing the key establishing problem from the MAC and physical layers, existing protocols are not practi- cable due to their overlength agreement packets and single round key establishment. To mitigate the impact of these problems, a group of design rules for sensor network secu- rity has been presented and TinyAKE, an authenticated key establishment protocol based on the key transportation with certificate mechanism, is proposed in this paper. The correct- ness and security of TinyAKE are proved, meanwhile, the performance of TinyAKE is analyzed and compared with the existing similar protocols. Finally TinyAKE is implemented in the TinyOS with TinyECC. The experimental and simulat- ing results show that the key transportation with certificate mechanism is feasible in WSNs and it is cost-effective for the repeated key establishment to be done with 2 rounds in TinyAKE.
